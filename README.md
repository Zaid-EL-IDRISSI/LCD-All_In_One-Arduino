# LCD-All_In_One-Arduino  

An **Arduino All-in-One project** combining a **Calculator**, a **Digital Clock (Horloge)**, and a **Temperature Reader**, all displayed on an LCD with keypad interaction.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is a prototype and experimental. The code works but is **not fully optimized or professional**.  

---

## 📌 Features

- ⏰ **Digital Clock**: Hours, minutes, seconds, date, month, year (with manual adjustment).  
- ➕ **Calculator**: Supports basic operations (+, -, *, /), including chained calculations and square root.  
- 🌡️ **Temperature Reader**: Measures in Celsius and displays current value on the LCD.  
- 🖥️ **LCD Display**: 16x2 with scrolling messages and simple animations.  
- 🎛️ **Keypad Interaction**: Analog input (A0) for entering numbers, operations, and navigation.

## 🆕 V2 Updates
- Improved calculator logic for chained calculations and powers.  
- Better handling of square roots and decimal numbers.  
- Cleaner display of results on LCD, including automatic alignment.  
- Simplified code structure for easier reading (still experimental).
